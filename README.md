# Jonathan Navarro - KDramas Watchlist
Hello, thank you for checking out my project.  
This is a fullstack application, a MEN-Stack CRUD app to be specific.  
The app was made to display a list of K-dramas. You can add specific K-dramas to your watchlist.  
You can also view reviews, which show the k-drama details and reviews for the selected drama.  
You can edit, create, or delete reviews.

## User Stories
- As the teacher of the student, I want to make sure the student used all previous knowledge they have been taught throughout unit 1 and 2.

- As a friend of the student, I want to make sure that the student has been making good use of their time and that the cohort was a good fit for them.

- As a fellow member of the cohort, I would like to see a professionally styled full stack application that is responsive.

## Unsolved Problems & Major Hurdles
The only problem I had was constantly finding new things to style and/or change.  
This project really solidified my understanding of CSS, I now understand what I need to do in order to get an element in a certain position.  
CSS Flex was a lifesaver when it came to displaying cards, but I really need to research CSS Grid more.
